    <div class="sec2">
        <p>SDG Goal 13 focuses on taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
            Climate change is one of the most significant threats to our planet, affecting ecosystems, economies,
            and communities globally. This goal underscores the need for global efforts to mitigate climate change,
            build resilience, and support vulnerable populations.<br>
            <br>
            Climate change is a global challenge that demands urgent, collective action. By achieving SDG Goal 13,
            we can limit global warming, protect vulnerable communities, and ensure a sustainable future for
            our planet.
